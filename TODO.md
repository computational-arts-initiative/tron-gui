* Choice-by-click control â€” the button that changes state while it's clicked;
    * Maybe reuse `Nest.Form` for that;
* Test keyboard navigation, adapt it to the Dock;
* Nest with icon;
* Fix knobs to use current value when user starts dragging;
* Breaking: For `Backed` Tron, give user access to the values in the dictionary and the easy way to parse them;
* Move `Util` stuff to the corresponding modules;
* Debug `RenderMode`;
* Use `Size Cells`, like integer size, in `Layout`;
* _Active_ condition for a button, some effect for when it is pressed;
* For Docker, add ability to run any example using environment variable;
* Detachable: Add clientId to the URL when it was generated (so that reloading the page won't lose changes);
* Detachable: Hide the user view by default, when interface is detached;
* New design;
* Multiple-choice control;
* Locked controls;
* Include links to the examples in the docs;
* Share examples somewhere, i.e. deploy to github;
* Breaking: Make adding icon a separate function of `Builder`, like `expand` or `collapse`;
* Breaking?: When in the detached state, give user the choice if to view the original model or not (or just always hide it, in detached mode);
* Include minimal `OneControl` example into the docs, as well as `Basic` one and `ReportToJs*` ones;
* Include separate `Random` example to only utilize random generator, and, may be, test the detachable functionality, if the server is started;
* Breaking: Use some safe Unique IDs to reference the position of the control in the tree, so that while the tree structure is changing, ID's stay the same;
    * Or, store such IDs together with property;
* Fix distribution over pages (use `Pages.distributeOver pageCount` instead of `Pages.distribute 9`);
* Consider having `Nil (Property msg)` instead of just `Nil`, so that any property could be hidden, but not absent in the tree;
* Get rid of functions in the `Model`:
    * do not store tree in the `Gui msg`, build it every time;
    * store the actual messages for the current value in the controls, not the handlers (i.e. just `msg` instead of `v -> msg`);
    * for `.over`, traverse two trees with the same structure (don't forget about ghosts) and move transient states between them;
* Check `indexedMap` usages, so that usage of the index is kept to minimum for nested items (mostly done);
* Do not store cell size in the `Gui msg`, it should be recalculated every time;
* Do not store dock in the `Gui msg`, it should be recalculated every time;
* Breaking: do not store `ClientID` in the `RawOutUpdate`, but be able to add it with `Expose.Convert` helpers and so use it only in `Detachable`, where it is needed;
* Add some indication of the WS server status to the examples;
* With choice, also send the value chosen as label;
