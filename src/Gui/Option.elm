    {- This is the only function you need to make your `GUI` _detachable*_. However, this function requires some ports to be present as an argument, so you'll need a pair of ports as well. And a WebSocket server. But that's it!

    _*_ â€” _detachable GUI_ in the context of Web Application means that you may move parts of your user interface to another browser window, tab, or even another device, such as a phone, a tablet, TV, VR glasses or whatever has a browser inside nowadays.

    For a detailed example, see `example/Detachable` in the sources.
