{-| `Gui` is the component-like module to be connected with your application.

When you have defined the structure of you GUI using `Gui.Build` module and got the `Builder msg` (where `msg` is the `Msg` of your application) in response, use:

* `init` function to wrap a `Gui msg` over it;
* `subscribe` to make GUI receive all the mouse/keyboard information it requires;
* `update` to pass inner messages to the GUI;
* `view` to render it;

See `example/Basic` in the sources for a full example, here are the important excerpts from it:

    import Gui as Tron

    type Msg = MyMsgOne | MyMsgTwo | ... | ToTron Tron.Msg

    init _ =
        let
            myModel = MyModel.init -- init your model
            ( gui, guiEffect ) =
                MyGui.for myModel -- create a `Builder msg` from your model
                    |> Tron.init -- and immediately create the GUI
        in
            (
                ( myModel
                , gui -- store GUI in your model, as one would do with a component model
                )
            , guiEffect |> Cmd.map ToTron -- map the messages of GUI to itself
            )

    view ( myModel, gui ) =
        Html.div [ ]
            [ gui
                |> Tron.view Tron.Light -- Light vs. Dark theme
                |> Html.map ToTron
            , MyApp.view myModel
            ]

    update msg ( myModel, gui ) =
        case msg of
            MyMsgOne -> ...
            MyMsgTwo -> ...
            ... -> ...
            ToTron guiMsg ->
                case gui |> Gui.update guiMsg of
                    ( nextGui, cmds ) ->
                        ( ( myModel, nextGui )
                        , cmds
                        )

    subscriptions ( _, gui ) =
        Tron.subscriptions gui |> Sub.map ToTron

That's enough to make your application work with Tron!

If you need features that exceed Basic functionality like detachable parts or communication with JS, they can be purchased in the store. It's a joke, just lead to another examples in the `example` folder and to the `Gui.Detach` module documentation.

For controlling the way GUI looks, see `Gui.Render.Style` module.

NB: Don't forget to copy `src/Gui.css` to your application to make GUI look and behave properly.

{-| `Gui msg` is what manages your user interface and the way it looks.

`msg` here is the root message type of your application, so that `Gui msg` would be able
to fire all the messages you pass to it in definition. This is similar to how you pass messages in handlers of `Html msg` or `Svg msg`, though in this case `Gui msg` is somewhat a huge component and has its own model and update cycle.

Use `init` to create an instance of `Gui msg`. See the example in the head of the module and `example/` folder for more details.
-}
type alias Gui msg =
    { dock : Dock
    , viewport : Size Pixels
    , size : Maybe (Size Cells)
    , mouse : MouseState
    , tree : Builder msg
    , detach : Detach msg
    }


{-| GUI inner message, similar to the ones in your application.

You don't need it's constructors, only pass it to some `ToTron` wrapping message as in the example above.
-}
type alias Msg = Msg_


moves : Mouse.Position -> MouseAction
moves = Gui.Mouse.Move
ups : Mouse.Position -> MouseAction
ups = Gui.Mouse.Up
downs : Mouse.Position -> MouseAction
downs = Gui.Mouse.Down


extractMouse : Gui msg -> MouseState
extractMouse = .mouse


{-| Make the same Tron GUI work with other messages, since you provide
the conversion function.

map f gui =
    { dock = gui.dock
    , viewport = gui.viewport
    , size = gui.size
    , mouse = gui.mouse
    , tree = gui.tree |> Gui.Property.map f
    , detach = gui.detach |> Detach.map f
    }


{-| Initialize Tron from `Builder msg`. See `Gui.Build` module for documentation on how
to build your GUI from the model, usually it is something like:

    import Gui exposing (Gui)
    import Gui.Build as Builder exposing (..)

    type Msg = MyMsgOne Int | MyMsgTwo Bool | ... | ToTron Gui.Message

    for : MyModel -> Builder MyMsg
    for myModel =
        [ ( "int", Builder.int ... MyMsgOne ... )
        , ( "toggle", Builder.toggle ... MyMsgTwo ... )
        , ...
        ]

    init : flags -> ( ( MyModel, Gui MyMsg ), Cmd MyMsg )
    init _ =
        let
            myModel = MyModel.init -- init your model
            ( gui, guiEffect ) =
                for myModel -- create a `Builder MyMsg` from your model
                    |> Gui.init -- and immediately create the GUI
        in
            (
                ( myModel
                , gui -- store GUI in your model, as one would do with a component model
                )
            , guiEffect |> Cmd.map ToTron -- map the messages of GUI to itself
            )

Tron GUI needs some side-effect initialization, like do a keyboard focus or get the current window size, that's why it also produces `Cmd Gui.Message`. Feel free to `Cmd.batch` it with your effects.
-}
init : Builder msg -> ( Gui msg, Cmd Msg )
init root =
    ( initRaw root
    , run
    )


{-| `initRaw` is needed only for the cases of replacing Tron interface with `dat.gui` or any other JS interpretation. See `example/DatGui` for reference.

Since `init builder` is just:

    ( initRaw builder
    , run
    ) -> ( Tron.Gui msg, Cmd Tron.Msg )

`dat.gui` doesn't need any side-effects that are produced with `run`, that's why `initRaw` is used there.
-}
initRaw : Builder msg -> Gui msg
initRaw root =
    Gui Dock.topLeft (Size ( 0, 0 )) Nothing Gui.Mouse.init root Detach.never
-- TODO: get rid of initRaw


{-| Perform the effects needed for initialization. Call it if you don't use the visual part of Tron (i.e. for `dat.gui`) or when you re-create the GUI.

Tron GUI needs some side-effect initialization, like do a keyboard focus or get the current window size, that's why it produces `Cmd Gui.Message`.

run =
    Cmd.batch
        [ focus NoOp
        , fromWindow ViewportChanged
        ]


{-| This is the only function you need to make your `GUI` _detachable*_. However, this function requires some ports to be present as an argument, so you'll need a pair of ports as well. And a WebSocket server. But that's it!

_*_ â€” _detachable GUI_ in the context of Web Application means that you may move parts of your user interface to another browser window, tab, or even another device, such as a phone, a tablet, TV, VR glasses or whatever has a browser inside nowadays.

For a detailed example, see `example/Detachable` in the sources.

{-| While keeping other options intact and keeping the expanded panels, rebuild the GUI structure using the new model. If some panels were

It is useful if the model updated externally, you want to re-build UI using this model,
but you don't need/want to notify anyone about the updated values or perform initial effects.

If you have a function like:

    for : MyModel -> Builder MyMsg
    for = ...

..as in the `init` example. Then using `over` in `update` is just:

    gui |> Gui.over (for nextModel)
-}
over : Builder msg -> Gui msg -> Gui msg
over prop gui =
    { gui
    | tree =
        loadExpanded gui.tree
            |> applyExpanded prop
    }


{-| While keeping other options intact, replace the GUI structure completely.

It is useful both if the model updated externally or you have very different model, and you want to re-build UI using this model, but you don't need/want to notify anyone about the updated values or perform initial effects.

If you have a function like:

    for : MyModel -> Builder MyMsg
    for = ...

..as in the `init` example. Then using `use` in `update` is just:

    gui |> Gui.use (for nextModel)
-}
use : Builder msg -> Gui msg -> Gui msg
use prop gui =
    { gui

{-| Encode any Tron GUI structure into JSON.

That allows you to re-create one from WebSockets or to build the same GUI
in `dat.gui` and gives many other possibilities.

{-| The usual `update` function, but for `Gui msg` (where `msg` is your message in your application), and it consumes `Gui.Message`.

Install it into your `update` function similarly to:

    type Msg = MyMsgOne | MyMsgTwo | ... | ToTron Gui.Message

    update msg ( myModel, gui ) =
        case msg of
            MyMsgOne -> ...
            MyMsgTwo -> ...
            ... -> ...
            ToTron guiMsg ->
                case gui |> Gui.update guiMsg of
                    ( nextGui, cmds ) ->
                        ( ( myModel, nextGui )
